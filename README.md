# ADAS-Road-Sign-Detection-FPGA

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) using VHDL on FPGA.

The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete solution for road sign detection, from training an ML model to deploying it on an FPGA for real-time use in an ADAS context ( **merging machine learning and embedded electronics for autonomous driving and driver assistance applications**).

## This project is into 4 several key sections, each serving a specific purpose:

-**Streamlit Application**(/streamlit_app): This directory contains the Streamlit-based user interface.
-**Detection Model**(/detection_model): Here, you'll find the machine learning-based detection model.
-**VHDL Implementation**(/vhdl_implementation): This section includes the VHDL code for FPGA implementation.
-**Testing & Validation**(/testing_and_validation): Explore this directory for information on testing the VHDL model on an FPGA platform.
